Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I'am web-developer. I've tried to start blog several times. 
This is another attempt to start blogging.  I'll write on 2 languages for this blog Russian and English.
My English is rather bad but I hope that english-speaker visitors will understand my posts.
My favorite language is python. I used django for developin. I will write some notes about this language
and web-framework. I'm interesting in modern js especialy for frontend. Here will be some posts about this.
I with it will be usefull for somebody.
